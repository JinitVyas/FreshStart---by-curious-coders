# FreshStart---by-curious-coders

FreshStart, a dynamic platform developed by the CuriousCoders team during a 48-hour hackathon, is designed to foster student mentorship within educational institutions. Leveraging PHP and Bootstrap, the platform provides an array of features, including user registration and authentication, mentorship matching, information sharing, and even an interactive campus map. Students can also stay updated about campus events.

However, it's important to note that due to the constraints of the hackathon, some components of FreshStart remain unfinished. Despite this, the team has a clear plan for future development to enhance and complete the platform, with a strong focus on usability and user experience.
